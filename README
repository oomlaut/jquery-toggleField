ABOUT
=====
toggleField.jquery.js is a multi-functional jQuery plug-in to enable 
behavior similar to the "placeholder" attribute on varieties of INPUT types 

REQUIREMENTS
============
- jQuery v1.3 or above

FEATURES
========
- Sets the "placeholder" attribute if it is not already defined
- Markup still validates in <HTML5 if "placeholder" property is omitted 
  and "title" or "label" is specified as the text-source
- Toggles the "value" of the field in browsers that do not support "placeholder"
- Clears the populated values on submit to assist with validation
- Mimics functionality for password fields by creating an adjacent text field 
  and toggling the two on focus/blur
- Tested browser-compatible back to IE6

TODO
====
- Consider implementation for TEXTAREA elements
- Include "force" option to override "placeholder" option
- Enforce behavior for HTML5 elements that do not display placeholder
